How to run locally
------------------

To run the project locally, make sure Node and Yarn are installed. Then run the following commands:

Install dependencies:

`$ yarn install`

Use nodemon to automatically reload code changes

`$ npx nodemon index`

Or just run index.js to run the server normally

`$ node index`

To enable updates to JavaScript changes using webpack --watch

`$ yarn watch`

Or, just build the production scripts before running node index above

`$ yarn build`
